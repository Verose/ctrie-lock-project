# Lock-based CTries
This is a fork of https://github.com/axel22/Ctries/

In this project, we attempt to do the following:
1. Replace the lock-free approach with a lock-based approach, and measure relative performance.
2. Potentially optimize the existing implemenation, regardless of locks, and achieve performance improvements.

Relevant code can be found in the code packages named ctrielock.
